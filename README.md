# -Global-GDP-Data
I developed a Python script to scrape global GDP data from Wikipedia using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. After extracting the data from HTML tables, I used pandas to clean and organize it, then exported the final dataset to a CSV file. This automated process made the data ready for analysis and visualization.
